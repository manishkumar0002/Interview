# 🟢 1️⃣ Tell Me About Yourself

Good morning Sir/Madam,

My name is Manish Kumar. I am from Bihar and currently living in Bhopal. I am pursuing my final year of Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from Technocrats Institute of Technology.

I have a strong understanding of Core Java and backend development, with hands-on experience in building real-time applications using Spring Boot and SQL. My major projects include an IRCTC-inspired Railway Reservation System and a Mess Management System, where I applied concepts like authentication, database design, and concurrency handling to solve practical problems.

I am also Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certified, which helped me understand cloud concepts and modern infrastructure.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and building scalable software systems. I am looking forward to joining an organization where I can contribute meaningfully and grow both technically and professionally.

Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself.
